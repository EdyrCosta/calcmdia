The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\Arquivos de programas\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\CalcMdia\Package\Project CalcMdia.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\Arquivos de programas\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\CalcMdia\Package\Support\Project CalcMdia.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
